# mp4_to_mp Script

This Python script is used to convert all `.mp4` files in the current folder to `.mp3` files. It uses the MoviePy library for the conversion.

## Installation

Before running the script, you need to install the required library. You can install the MoviePy library with the following command:

```bash
pip install moviepy
```

## Usage
To use this script, simply place all the .mp4 files you want to convert in the same directory. Then, run the following command:

```bash
python your_script.py
```
And mp3converter.exe is the exe file I packaged. It should be usable directly on win10 and 11 systems.
